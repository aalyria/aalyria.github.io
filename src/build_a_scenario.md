# Building a Scenario Tutorial

This tutorial describes step-by-step instructions for building a scneario using Spacetime's NBI. 
At the end of this tutorial, you will have built a network that looks like this:
![Completed scenario](/assets/scenario_building_screenshots/service_request_on_map.png)

## gRPC and Protocol Buffers

Calls to Spacetime's endpoints can be made using the [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) RPC
framework in combination with
[Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview)
to serialize requests and responses. In practice, this means that software
applications that interact with the SDN Controller will call out to these
endpoints using client libraries generated by the gRPC framework in your
[language of choice](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/) from our
[interface descriptions](https://github.com/aalyria/api).

> ℹ️ For more info detailing the the creation and usage of these client
> libraries, see the
> [gRPC Basics Tutorial](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/java/basics/).

However, to get started exploring the APIs without first building an entire
application, we can use [nbictl](https://github.com/aalyria/api/tree/main/tools/nbictl), a tool that lets you interact with NBI API from the command-line.

## Getting started with `nbictl`

1. To start accessing the NBI APIs, first generate an Private-Public Keypair using the `nbictl generate-keys` command: 

   ```sh
   $ nbictl generate-keys --org "my-organization.com"
   private key is stored under: ~/.config/nbictl/keys/922e75e63659b29b76631275.key
   certificate is stored under: ~/.config/nbictl/keys/922e75e63659b29b76631275.crt
   ```
   Once you generated the keypair, you'll need to send the `.crt` file (a self-signed x509 certificate containing the public key) to Aalyria.
   
   > ⚠️ Only share the public certificate (`.crt`) with Aalyria or third-parties.
   > The private key (`.key`) must be protected and should never be sent by email
   > or communicated to others in any.

   
   After granting access to your keypair, Aalyria will provide the `USER_ID` and `KEY_ID` that identify the keypair within Spacetime. These settings are necessary to configure `nbictl`, or any [SDK Library](https://github.com/aalyria/api) that allow to authenticate to Spacetime.


2. Next step you will have to configure `nbictl` with the right parameters for your Spacetime instance and your keypair.
   
   ```sh
   $ nbictl set-context --url "nbi.$INSTANCE.spacetime.aalyria.com:443"
   $ nbictl set-context --key_id "$KEY_ID"
   $ nbictl set-context --user_id "$USER_ID"
   $ nbictl set-context --priv_key "$PRIVATE_KEY_FILE_NAME"
   ```

3. To verify access to the Spacetime APIs, you can issue a request to `list` of all of the `NETWORK_NODES` present in the instance:
   
   ```sh
   $ nbictl list --type "NETWORK_NODE"
   ```

   The results returned will depend on the state of the Spacetime instance. It is normal for the results to be empty if no network nodes have yet been created in the instance.

## "Entities" and the NBI

Interactions with the NBI happen primarily through the manipulation of
"entities", which are persistent mutable resources. Each entity has a "type"
that dictates the nature of the data it holds. For example, we queried for
`NETWORK_NODE`-type entities above. Entity types include `ANTENNA_PATTERN`
entities, `PLATFORM_DEFINITION` entities, `SERVICE_REQUEST` entities, among
others. The complete list of types can be found in our NBI interface
description
[here](https://github.com/aalyria/api/blob/main/api/nbi/v1alpha/nbi.proto#L40).

By manipulating these entities we can do things such as configure the SDN
Controller with the properties of the networks it is orchestrating, or request
that traffic be routed across that network.

### Entity commit timestamps and optimistic concurrency control

Each version of an entity is automatically assigned a "commit timestamp".
Spacetime assigns a commit timestamp to each entity upon creating it, and that
commit timestamp is automatically changed to a new, unique value each time the
entity is updated.

Commit timestamps play an important role in Spacetime’s
[optimistic concurrency control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimistic_concurrency_control).
When updating or deleting an entity one must provide the commit timestamp of
the version of the entity being modified. If Spacetime finds that the provided
commit timestamp does not match the commit timestamp of the entity being
modified, it will reject the change. Such an occurrence indicates that another
user has modified the entity concurrently, and the rejection is intended to
prevent accidental overwriting of the other user’s changes.

### In action

To see this in action, let’s create, update, and then delete a `NETWORK_NODE`
entity.

1. Create a new `NETWORK_NODE` entity using the `nbictl create` command

   > ℹ️ The network node created here is functionally useless. It does not have
   > any network interfaces attached. However it will do for now as a means to
   > explore the entity lifecycle.

   To create a new entity using `nbictl`, we first have to create a `.textproto` file that contains entity information you want to create. 

   ```textproto
   group: {
     type: NETWORK_NODE
   }
   network_node {
     name: "my-node"
   }
   ```

   After creating the `.textproto` file, let's create a new network node entity by running:

   ```sh 
   $ nbictl create --files="~/path/to/*.textproto" 
   ```

   Spacetime will respond with the created entity. It should look something like:

   ```textproto
   group: {
     type: NETWORK_NODE
   }
   id: "8fbff64e-d12a-47b2-9a85-117492ac4aad"
   commit_timestamp: 1690841566394521
   network_node: {
     name: "my-node"
   }
   ```

   Note that Spacetime has assigned the entity an ID and a commit timestamp.

2. Now, let's modify the network node entity by invoking the `nbictl update` command.
   We'll attach a network interface to the network node entity. Recall that, for concurrency
   control, we must provide the commit timestamp of the entity version we are
   overwriting. 

   First, similar to when creating a new entity, let's create a `.textproto` file that contains an updates for an entity: 

   ```textproto
   commit_timestamp: 1690841566394521
   id: "8fbff64e-d12a-47b2-9a85-117492ac4aad"
   group: {
     type: NETWORK_NODE
   }
   network_node {
     name: "my-node"
     node_interface: {
       interface_id: "eth0"
       wired: {}
     }
   }
   ```

   Then, run:

   ```sh
   $ nbictl update --files="~/path/to/*.textproto"
   ```

   Spacetime should then respond with the updated entity, something like:

   ```textproto
    group: {
      type: NETWORK_NODE
    },
    id: "8fbff64e-d12a-47b2-9a85-117492ac4aad",
    commit_timestamp: 1690841671414501,
    network_node: {
      name: "my-node",
      node_interface: [
        {
          interface_id: "eth0"
          wired: {}
        }
      ]
    }
   ```

   Note that Spacetime has changed the entity's commit timestamp to reflect the
   new revision of the entity.

3. Finally, we can delete the network node entity by invoking the `nbictl delete` command.
   Once more, we must include the commit timestamp of the entity we are modifying:

   ```sh
   $ nbictl delete \
       --id "8fbff64e-d12a-47b2-9a85-117492ac4aad" \
       --commit_time 1690841671414501 --type "NETWORK_NODE"
   ```

## Defining a network

The entity types essential for defining a network are:

- [`PLATFORM_DEFINITION`](https://github.com/aalyria/api/blob/main/api/common/platform.proto) entities, 
  which define instances of physical objects ("platforms") in the network
  (satellites, ships, or aircraft, for instance). The entities specify attributes
  of the platforms, including their motion, and any wireless transceivers mounted on the platforms.

- [`ANTENNA_PATTERN`](https://github.com/aalyria/api/blob/main/api/nbi/v1alpha/resources/antenna_pattern.proto) entities,
  which define any three-dimensional antenna 
  [radiation patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_pattern) needed
  to describe the radiation or receiving properties of any antennas in the network.

- [`BAND_PROFILE`](https://github.com/aalyria/api/blob/main/api/common/channel.proto) entities,
  which define the wireless frequency bands with which the network's transceivers are compatible.

- [`NETWORK_NODE`](https://github.com/aalyria/api/blob/main/api/nbi/v1alpha/resources/network_element.proto) entities,
  which define the logical network devices in the network and their attributes, including IP
  addresses and subnets.

- [`INTERFACE_LINK_REPORT`](https://github.com/aalyria/api/blob/main/api/nbi/v1alpha/resources/network_link.proto)
  entities, which define the static links in the network. Most typically these are used to
  define a terrestrial network topology.

We can employ the `CreateEntity`, `UpdateEntity`, and `DeleteEntity` operations
on entities of these types to define networks in Spacetime. As an example,
let's define a simple network composed of a satellite, a user terminal, a
gateway, and a
[point of presence (PoP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_presence).

The user terminal and gateway will each have a single transmitter and receiver.
The satellite will have two: one for the user link and one for the gateway
link.

### Defining a band profile

First we'll create a `BAND_PROFILE` representing a wireless band made up of
250 MHz-wide channels. This will define the wireless medium to be used by the
wireless links in our network. In the same entity we must also define a "rate
table" specifying how the capacity of a link in this band depends on the
[SNIR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-interference-plus-noise_ratio)
at a receiver.

`bandprofile.textproto` file:

```textproto
id: "test-band-profile"
group: {
  type: BAND_PROFILE
}
band_profile {
  channel_width_hz: 250000000
  rate_table: {
    steps: {
      min_received_signal_power_dbw: -100
      tx_data_rate_bps: 1e8
    }
    steps: {
      min_received_signal_power_dbw: -90
      tx_data_rate_bps: 2e8
    }
    steps: {
      min_received_signal_power_dbw: -80
      tx_data_rate_bps: 3e8
    }
  }
}
```

```sh
$ nbictl create --files="~/path/to/band_profile.textproto
```

### Defining antenna patterns

Next, we can use antenna patterns to define how radiation is emitted or
received from the antennas in the network. For now, we'll assume that all
antennas in our network are identical, so a single antenna pattern is sufficient:

> ℹ️ In the interest of simplicity, we'll assume our antennas are all
> [parabolic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabolic_antenna), though
> Spacetime supports arbitrary
> [user-defined radiation patterns](https://github.com/aalyria/api/blob/main/api/nbi/v1alpha/resources/antenna_pattern.proto).
`antenna_pattern.textproto` file: 

```textproto
id: "test-antenna-pattern"
group: {
  type: ANTENNA_PATTERN
}
antenna_pattern {
  parabolic_pattern: {
    diameter_m: 1
    efficiency_percent: 0.9
    backlobe_gain_db: -60
  }
}
```

```sh
$ nbictl create --files="~/path/to/antenna_pattern.textproto"
```

### Defining the user terminal

We can now begin defining the network assets themselves. The user terminal,
gateway, and satellite will each be defined by a combination of two entities:
(1) `PLATFORM_DEFINITION` entity defining the physical characteristics of the
asset and (2) a `NETWORK_NODE` entity defining the logical network attributes
of the asset.

To define the user terminal, we first create its `PLATFORM_DEFINITION`
entity. In a 5G non-terrestrial networking (NTN) architecture, this would
correspond to user equipment.
`user_terminal.textproto` file:

```textproto
id: "test-user-terminal-platform-definition"
group: {
  type: PLATFORM_DEFINITION
}
platform {
  name: "user-terminal"
  type: "UserTerminal"
  coordinates: {
    geodetic_wgs84: {
      longitude_deg: -121.7
      latitude_deg: 37.7
    }
  }

  transceiver_model: {
    id: "transceiver-model"

    transmitter: {
      name: "tx"
      channel_set: {
        key: "test-band-profile"
        value: {
          channel: {
            key: 1000000000
            value: {
              max_power_watts: 100
            }
          }
        }
      }
      signal_processing_step: {
        amplifier: {
          constant_gain: {
            gain_db: 10
            noise_factor: 1
            reference_temperature_k: 290
          }
        }
      }
    }

    receiver: {
      name: "rx"
      channel_set: {
        key: "test-band-profile"
        value: {
          center_frequency_hz: 12000000000
        }
      }
      signal_processing_step: {
        amplifier: {
          constant_gain: {
            gain_db: 10
            noise_factor: 1
            reference_temperature_k: 290
          }
        }
      }
    }

    antenna: {
      name: "antenna"
      antenna_pattern_id: "test-antenna-pattern"
      targeting: {}
    }

    macs {
      type: "DVBS2"
      role: "HUB"
      max_connections: 1
    }
  }
}
```

```sh
$ nbictl create --files="~/path/to/user_terminal.textproto"
```

This entity is verbose, but it is fairly simple. In short, it
specifies that:

- The user terminal is placed on the ground in Livermore, California.
- The user terminal has a single transceiver, operating in the band we defined
  earlier (note the `test-band-profile` reference).
- The transmitter is capable of operating at 11 Ghz, while the receiver
  operates at 12 GHz.
- The transmit and receive signal chains each contain a low-noise amplifier.
- The attached antenna exihibits the radiation properties of a 1 meter
  parabolic dish as defined earlier (note the `test-antenna-pattern` reference).
- The attached antenna is steerable.

The Map tab of your scenario should now resemble:
![User terminal on map](/assets/scenario_building_screenshots/user_terminal_on_map.png)

Now we define the user terminal's `NETWORK_NODE` to represent its logical
network representation.
`user_terminal_network_node.textproto` file:

```textproto
id: "test-user-terminal-network-node"
group: {
  type: NETWORK_NODE
}
network_node {
  name: "user-terminal"
  type: "UserTerminal"
  node_interface: {
    interface_id: "wireless"
    wireless: {
      transceiver_model_id: {
        platform_id: "test-user-terminal-platform-definition"
        transceiver_model_id: "transceiver-model"
      }
    }
  }
  subnet: "fd00:0:0:2a:0:0:0:0/64"
}
```

```sh
$ nbictl create --files="~/path/to/user_terminal_network_node.textproto"
```

This entity declares a network node with a single interface, and ties the
interface to the user terminal's transceiver. This means that the interface's
connectivity is determined by the connectivity of the transceiver.

The Graph tab of your scenario should now resemble:
![User terminal on graph](/assets/scenario_building_screenshots/user_terminal_on_graph.png)

And with that, our user terminal is complete. We'll follow a similar process
for the remaining assets.

### Defining the gateway

The gateway is much like the user terminal except that:

- Its location is different.
- In addition to its wireless interface, it also has a WAN-facing wired
  interface attached.

In a 5G non-terrestrial networking (NTN) architecture, this would
correspond to a gNodeB (or basestation).
`gateway.textproto` file: 

```textproto
id: "test-gateway-platform-definition"
group: {
  type: PLATFORM_DEFINITION
}
platform {
  name: "gateway"
  type: "Gateway"
  coordinates: {
    geodetic_wgs84: {
      longitude_deg: -121.1
      latitude_deg: 35.4
    }
  }

  transceiver_model: {
    id: "transceiver-model"

    transmitter: {
      name: "tx"
      channel_set: {
        key: "test-band-profile"
        value: {
          channel: {
            key: 13000000000
            value: {
              max_power_watts: 100
            }
          }
        }
      }
      signal_processing_step: {
        amplifier: {
          constant_gain: {
            gain_db: 10
            noise_factor: 1
            reference_temperature_k: 290
          }
        }
      }
    }

    receiver: {
      name: "rx"
      channel_set: {
        key: "test-band-profile"
        value: {
          center_frequency_hz: 14000000000
        }
      }
      signal_processing_step: {
        amplifier: {
          constant_gain: {
            gain_db: 10
            noise_factor: 1
            reference_temperature_k: 290
          }
        }
      }
    }

    antenna: {
      name: "antenna"
      antenna_pattern_id: "test-antenna-pattern"
      targeting: {}
    }

    macs {
      type: "DVBS2"
      role: "HUB"
      max_connections: 1
    }
  }
}
```

```sh
$ nbictl create --files="~/path/to/gateway.textproto"
```

The Map tab of your scenario should now resemble:
![Gateway on map](/assets/scenario_building_screenshots/gateway_on_map.png)

`gateway_network_node.textproto` file:

```textproto
id: "test-gateway-network-node"
group: {
  type: NETWORK_NODE
}
network_node {
  name: "gateway"
  type: "Gateway"
  node_interface: {
    interface_id: "wireless"
    wireless: {
      transceiver_model_id: {
        platform_id: "test-gateway-platform-definition"
        transceiver_model_id: "transceiver-model"
      }
    }
  }
  node_interface: {
    interface_id: "wan"
    wired: {}
  }
}
```

```sh
$ nbictl create --files="~/path/to/gateway_network_node.textproto"
```

The Graph tab of your scenario should now resemble:
![Gateway on graph](/assets/scenario_building_screenshots/gateway_on_graph.png)

### Defining the satellite

The configuration required to define a satellite is not dramatically different
from that required to define a user terminal or gateway. Among them the
satellite is unique however in that:

- It has two transceivers: one for the user link and one for the gateway link.
- It is in GEO.

For the sake of this tutorial, we will assume that our satellite has a fixed
position, but Spacetime supports defining many complex types of [motion](https://github.com/aalyria/api/blob/main/api/common/coordinates.proto).

In a 5G NTN architecture, these satellites might use FR1 or FR2 bands.
`satellite.textproto` file:

```textproto
id: "test-satellite-platform-definition"
group: {
  type: PLATFORM_DEFINITION
}
platform {
  name: "sat"
  type: "GEO"
  coordinates: {
    geodetic_wgs84: {
      longitude_deg: -121.1

    }
  }

        }
      }

        }
      }
    }

    antenna: {
      name: "antenna"
      antenna_pattern_id: "test-antenna-pattern"
      targeting: {}
    }

    macs {

}

  node_interface: {

    wireless: {

        transceiver_model_id: "gateway-link-transceiver-model"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```sh
$ nbictl create --files="~/path/to/satellite_network_node.textproto"
```

Your scenario should now resemble:

### Defining the terrestrial network

Finally, let's define the terrestrial network. The network is to be made up of
a point of presence (PoP) connected to the gateway by a terrestrial link. It is
worth noting that while the user terminal, gateway, and satellite were all
defined using a combination of a `PLATFORM_DEFINITION` entities and
`NETWORK_NODE` entities, the PoP can be defined without a `PLATFORM_DEFINITON`
at all. This is because the PoP has no wireless interfaces, so connectivity to
the PoP is not impacted by the physical attributes one might specify in a
`PLATFORM_DEFINITION`.

We begin with the PoP's `NETWORK_NODE`:

`pop_network_node.textproto` file:

```textproto
id: "test-pop-network-node"
group: {
  type: NETWORK_NODE
}
network_node {
  name: "pop"
  type: "POP"
  node_interface: {
    interface_id: "wan"
    wired: {}
  }
}
```

```sh
$ nbictl create --files="~/path/to/terrestrial_network_node.textproto"
```

The Graph tab of your scenario should now resemble:
![PoP on graph](/assets/scenario_building_screenshots/pop_on_graph.png)

And then we can add the terrestrial links. One from the PoP to the gateway:

`terrestrial_gateway.textproto` file:

```textproto
id: "test-pop-to-gateway-interface-link-report"
group: {
  type: INTERFACE_LINK_REPORT
}
interface_link_report: {
  links: {
    access_intervals: {
      accessibility: ACCESS_EXISTS
      data_rate_bps: 1e+12
    }
    dst: {
      node_id: "test-gateway-network-node"
      interface_id: "wan"
    }
  }
  src: {
    node_id: "test-pop-network-node"
    interface_id: "wan"
  }
}
```

```sh
$ nbictl create --files="~/path/to/terrestrial_gateway.textproto"
```

and then another in the opposite direction:

`terrestrial_gateway_opposite.textproto` file:

```textproto

id: "test-gateway-to-pop-interface-link-report"
group: {
  type: INTERFACE_LINK_REPORT
}
interface_link_report: {
  links: {
    access_intervals: {
      accessibility: ACCESS_EXISTS
      data_rate_bps: 1e+12
    }
    dst: {
      node_id: "test-pop-network-node"
      interface_id: "wan"
    }
  }
  src: {
    node_id: "test-gateway-network-node"
    interface_id: "wan"
  }
}
```

```sh
$ nbictl create --files="terrestrial_gateway_opposite.textproto"
```

and with that, we've completed our definition of a minimal network.

## Requesting a service

Spacetime orchestrates a network with the objective of satisfying or fulfilling
services requested of the network. So, to see Spacetime's orchestration in
action, we must issue a service request. This can be accomplished by creating a
`SERVICE_REQUEST` entity. Let's request service between the user terminal and
the PoP:

`service_request.textproto` file:

```proto
id: "test-pop-to-user-terminal-service-request"
group: {
  type: SERVICE_REQUEST
}
service_request {
  src_node_id: "test-pop-network-node"
  dst_node_id: "test-user-terminal-network-node"
  requirements: {
    bandwidth_bps_requested: 1e+06
  }
}
```

```sh
$ nbictl create --files="~/path/to/service_request.textproto
```

The Map tab of your scenario should now resemble:
![Service request on map](/assets/scenario_building_screenshots/service_request_on_map.png)

And that's it! Head to the [Github repository](https://github.com/aalyria/api) to understand
the range of Spacetime's object model and how to express more complex network capabilities.
